As a Django Developer, I can implement a custom user authentication system, So that the application can support multifactor authentication and improve security.

Acceptance Criteria:

Integration and Compatibility: The custom authentication system works with Django's built-in User model and can be easily integrated with third-party authentication services.

Performance and Scalability: Authentication processes are efficient, minimizing delays in user login and supporting a high number of simultaneous authentication requests.

Security and Best Practices: The system uses secure storage of credentials, protects against brute force attacks, and logs authentication attempts for security monitoring. It follows Django's documentation for custom authentication systems to ensure a secure and maintainable implementation.
